#### Anything Not Discussed
- everything that was scheduled was discussed

### Decisions & Reasoning
- When should the timer end? When the tasks are finished or when the user decides
  - The timer will stop when the tasks finish, not decided by the user
  - Modal will pop up, say that you are finished
  - When tasks are finished, they will gray out
  - Tasks will be sequential, be grayed out as they are "finished"
- Current tasks
  - Highlight the current task (move to top)
  - Shift finished tasks to the bottom
- Should be more thorough with documentation of code
  - Function description (followed by blank line)
  - @param {type} \[description of parameter goes here\]
  - @return {type} \[description of return value goes here \]
- Need to add button to end timer and to manually end task
  - Give the user control of when they complete their work, not the timer
  - When task is finished, change boolean attribute to false
- Go back button/page refresh - ask user if they want to end
  - "If you refresh the page, your changes will be lost"
  - Possibly store progress on current tasks?
- If done, clear storage and return to landing page
  - 3 possible ways: end session button (delete all tasks), delete current task
  - "Do you want to delete your tasks?" after you click end session
- When a task is finished before timer runs out, review the task (button)

### Action Items
- **Everyone:** daily standup notes, VSCode extensions (Prettier, CircleCI, ESLint), unit tests with Jest
- **Farheen:** add back the JS that was deleted, add progress tracker (alert or bar) to measure task completion
- **David, Elaine, Yueqi:** figure out what happens when the user finishes prematurely (button, alert)
- **Miguel:** end session button (go back to landing page)
- **Ryan:** Add link to instructions page for tasks page first time
- **Upo:** Finalize JSDocs, add time/points to issue backlog
- **David:** Comment & create documentation for code
