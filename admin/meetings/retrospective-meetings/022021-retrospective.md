### Retrospective

#### Sprint Progress

#### What went well?
- team members learned what they needed to do very quickly, executed tasks well
- members reached out for help when they needed it
- members actively suggested improvements on the architechture of the application
  - for instance, converting the timer page from multiple pages (work, short break, long break) into a single timer page
- in meetings during our sprint, members gave suggestions on each other's work and possible improvements
- adopted incremental and iterative work process quite naturally

#### What can we improve for next time?
- assigned very small tasks to individual developers; for next sprint, give larger tasks for the 2 week sprint
- developers did not follow branch creation and GitHub guidelines as closely as possible which resulted in a lot of merge conflicts; for next sprint, we will follow our guidelines better
- only had one meeting per week; for next sprint, possibly have multiple meetings
- lack of cross collaboration and keeping other team members updated; for next time, complete standup notes and provide updates on time
  - completed work twice because of miscommunications (for connecting the core functionality), this was inefficient and can be improved with more communication

#### Key Points & Action Items
- continue to do daily standup to keep track of the health of our group
- polish the timer to transition smoothly between work and break sessions
- merge all elements together to have all components work together
- assign larger tasks to larger subteams for sprint 2
- increase meeting cadence to twice per week for sprint 2
- adhere to GitHub best practices established in previous meetings
