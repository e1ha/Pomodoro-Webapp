<h1><span style="color: red;">Anoushka D.</span></h1>

### What did you work on yesterday?
- Yesterday, I was able to fully complete my part of the Tasks Page.
- I added the headers, start button, and question mark button.

### What are your blockers?
- I am waiting for Ryan to complete his part; but this isn't really a blocker as I finished my part already.

### What will you work on today?
- I have to wait for Ryan's part to be complete to help him fix the padding and margins. Until he is done, I can't work on anything more for this sprint.

### How close are we to hitting our sprint goals?
- We will definitely hit our sprint goals as we are pretty close to being done with the Tasks Page.
