# Team Roles

* Status: Accepted
* Deciders: Uposhanto Bhattacharya, Trevor Tsai, Ryan Bui, Qingyuan Zhang, Farheen Ansari, Yueqi Wang, Elaine Ha, Anoushka Dave, Miguel Serrano
* Date: 01/31/2021

## Context and Problem Statement

Most team members want to take on the role of a developer. How should we assign the different roles (designer, developer, tester, builder) to each team member?

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

* We want to ensure that every team member receives exposure in a role they want to learn more about.

## Considered Options

* Option 1: Team coordinators can assign each team member to a role based on what they have the most experience in.
* Option 2: Team coordinators can assign each team member to a role based on what they have the most interest in. 
* Option 3: Gauge interest of the team members in the different roles & have team coordinators randomly assign them.
* Option 4: Remove roles completely and work on each portion together (meaning that the full team designs together, then develops & tests & build together).

## Decision Outcome

Chose **Option 3**. The team coordinators will send a Google Form to get top two choices (Designer, Developer, Tester, Builder). 
Then, they will use a random number generator to be as fair as possible when spliting up the roles.
The team member that is assigned their role can be the lead for that role. The remaining team members will support them in all tasks. 
In this way, the other team members will also be exposed to every available role & we will have (a) main point of contact(s) responsible for each role.
